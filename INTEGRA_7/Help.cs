    /// Each tone type has a default description help item that is shown in case a control does not have a help item, and when edit
    /// page is navigated to.
    /// At top level there is a list of lists. It has 6 entries, 5 for the different tone types and one for MFX help items.
    /// The five entries for the different tone types has one list for each control page (Common, Wave etc).
    /// Each of those entries has a list with one or more entries.
    /// Those entries are the actual help items.
    /// ComboBox controls can have more than one such entry, each corresponding to a selected item in the ComboBox, giving help on each selected item.
    /// Other types of controls can only have one such entry.
    /// 
    /// All pages in Edit has a set of common controls that are always shown. Those are declaired in Edit.xaml and has dedicated GotFocus handlers to show their help items.
    /// The Grid ControlsGrid in Edit.xaml is populated dynamically for each Tone Type and selected parameter page.
    /// Help items must occur in the same order in the lists as they are created.
    /// All those controls GotFocus use the same handler, Generic_GotFocus.
    /// They all carry a Tag with the same controlsIndex as the corresponding help item.
    /// Therefore, all controls in a page start controlsIndex from zero and count up per control,
    /// and all help items are created the same way.
    /// So, controlsIndex is the third list index.
    /// First tone type (PCM Synth Tone) has list number zero.
    /// First control page has the first list number in its list number.
    /// First control in a control page has the first control number in its page number in its list number.
    /// BUT! Since the default page description and the common controls take up space, all dynamic controls are shifted by means of an offset in Skip.
    /// Skip is calculated to allow for changes regarding the common controls.
    /// 
    /// MFX control help items resides in the last top-level list.
    /// MFX help items does not need to use the offset in Skip since the main help texts and common controls help text is not in this list.
    /// 
    /// Examples:
    /// 0,0,0,0  = default text for PCM Synth Tone
    /// 0,0,1,0  = text for the Part selector
    /// 0,0,2,0  = text for the Tone category selector
    /// 0,0,9,0  = text for the Return button
    /// 0,0,10,0 = text for the first dynamically added control on the Common control page of PCM Synth Tone
    /// 0,1,10,0 = text for the first dynamically added control on the Wave control page of PCM Synth Tone
    /// 1,0,11,0 = text for the second dynamically added control on the Wave control page of SuperNATURAL Acoustic Tone
