Navigation tests
	Navigation should be possible in all sequencies as defined below, from app start.
	Listing studio set in librarian or starting studio set editorcauses studio set names
	to be read, but only if not already read. Test that it works both ways.

	L = Librarian
	S = Settings
	M = Motional surround
	T = Tone edit
	E = Edit studio set

	L-S-L
	  `-M
	   `-T
	    `-E
	L - M
	L - T
	L - E
	etc.

Parameter tests
	Known is that many parameters does not show initial value in their labels,
	but those who does, check the value.
	All controls must have correct initial value.
	All controls must update I-7.
	All controls must operate in correct range (probably only applies to sliders).

Functional tests
	Functions like Save Load Play etc must work.

Bugs

* App-start -> select group Studio sets -> Select a studio set: Nothing happens!

* Motional surround: Whatever label is focused, Ext moves, and then immediately moves back!
