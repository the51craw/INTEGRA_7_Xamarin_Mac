Bugs:

* Grouplist has an empty entry before Studio Sets.

* Add favorites: create folder button stays disabled.

* Edit tone is still enabled when a module tone is selected. (Module tones cannot be edited.)

* User color settings are not restored when re-entering settings.

* Wrong background color when entering settings.

* Labels for scheme and type are interchanged.

? Saving a tone (PCM tested) -> ‘Sorry, that name already exists…’ and the dialog has two Ok buttons.

* Studio set editor: search tone has always zero hits.

* After selecting studio set: column label for categories still show ‘Studio sets’.

* Enable the column 'lable' button, it looks better.

Why does it take so long to find I-7?

* Hide file save/load buttons and selections.
    They may lager be implemented again.

* Save in tone edit has very high controls. Fix height in all edit pages (add rowdefinitions).

* SN-D cannot be edited! This fix probably explained some spurious crashes.

* Check/fix height of controls in SN-D edit pages.

* Add store images!

Edit tone takes long time when selecting wave page. (Probably filling out wave list takes too long.)
    Remove possibility to change type!
    Add 'please wait' while filling out wave list at first edit of respective types.
    Keep wave lists for all types.

Height of MFX pages are not all same.

* Selecting MFX control after MFX in PCM-D made app crash (happened once).

* Changing synth type in edit did not reset edit page. Remove possibility to change type.
    Control is just disabled. Future versions may have this back.

* User tones not found from librarian search!

* After a search in librarian, changing tone no longer works.


Features to add:

Add play button in studio set editor.

Add sustain pedal.
